This shows some similarities with the results found by using SOM and Ward even though the network was based only in three of eight topics. Above is described each cluster to guide the user:\n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 0 (Slightly desaturated cyan): It is not characterized by a specific topic; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence”, “Information Analysis and Management”, “Data Science and Advanced Analytics”, “Information Systems and Technologies Management”, “Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence”, “Risk Analysis and Management”, “Law and Financial Markets”, “Marketing Intelligence” and “Marketing Research and CRM”. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 1 (Soft red): It is characterized by the topic “Land_cover/GIS/Geospatial/Maps/Urbanism/Cities”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Geospatial Technologies”, “Geographic Information Systems and Science”. Theses in this cluster have many connections with other theses. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 2 ( Dark moderate lime green): It is characterized by the topic “Health Management Education” Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Clinical Research Management”. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 3 (Dark moderate magenta): It is characterized by the “Busines_Intelligence_\u0026_Process/Knowledge_Management/Organizations; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence” and “Information Systems and Technologies Management”. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 4 (Very light yellow): It is characterized by the topic “GA/GP/GSGP/Machine_Learning_algorithms”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Data science and advanced Analytics”.\n",
